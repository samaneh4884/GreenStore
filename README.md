Project Description:
Intelligent online store management system with an environmental sustainability approach

Introduction:
With the rapid expansion of e-commerce, online stores have become one of the most important tools for buying and selling goods. However, most current stores focus only on the buying and selling process and the specific needs of customers, without paying enough attention to environmental sustainability aspects.

The present project aims to design and implement an intelligent and sustainable online store. In addition to common online store features (such as user registration, shopping cart, online payment, product and order management), it includes special capabilities that provide a personalized shopping experience compatible with environmental sustainability for users.
Project Goals:

1. Personalizing the User Purchase Experience:
The system allows users to select their mood or situation at the time of purchase (for example: happy, unhappy, etc.). Based on this selection, the store displays a set of products that match the user’s condition.

2. Improving Customer Interaction through Smart Feedback:
After each purchase, a short and targeted question is asked from the user to collect feedback about their experience with the product. This data is used to improve services and future recommendations.

3. Encouraging Green Purchases and Eco-Friendly Behaviors:
The system considers users who purchase products compatible with the environment or that have recyclable packaging. Special points or rewards are given for such purchases. These points can be used in future purchases as discounts or other benefits.

4. Pre-Selling Innovative Products:
The store provides the possibility of pre-selling products that have not yet been produced. If the pre-order reaches a certain level, production of the product begins. This feature allows producers to ensure there is real market demand before mass production.
Problems and Needs That This Software Solves:

Lack of Personalization in Existing Stores:
Many online stores offer the same suggestions to all users, without considering the specific interests or situation of each user. This system provides products based on the user’s selected preferences, offering a unique and purposeful experience.

Reduced Interaction and Customer Loyalty:
The lack of effective two-way communication with customers leads to reduced satisfaction and loyalty. By adding short surveys after purchase, the system collects valuable data for analyzing customer behavior.

Neglect of Environmental Sustainability in Online Shopping:
This store, with its rating system for eco-friendly purchases, promotes a green consumption culture and strengthens social responsibility and the brand.

High Risk of Production Without Demand Assessment:
The pre-sale capability helps businesses ensure market acceptance and prevent unnecessary production.
